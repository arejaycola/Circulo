## Getting things running...

Running `npm install` in the project root (where ever package.json lives) should get things installed correctly.

Once you have finished installing the application use `npm start` to start the application in development mode.

Running `npm test` in the project root will run the Jest test runner with several tests that I have implemented.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
